								Project<numscale>

Description:
	numscale is a number format translate tool.Call it 'nums'.nums can translates the target from a type indicated by its prefix to other.
	Usage: nums <-x | -o | -d | -b> <target>

Design reason:
	Test for myself and i gonna make this tool to help my work.

Structure:
	C++ designed structures.

	type tower>
	     
		Hex		Oct
			Dec
		Bin

		# in this tower,it's not a line chart.
		# for transform scale of the argument,should let it transform to Dec,then transform Dec to aimmed format.
		
	Algorithm>
		Combine from data let it becomes a Dec number.
		
		Sum = a1 * SCALE^(i - 1) + a2 * SCALE^(i - 1) + ... + an * SCALE^(i = n - 1) ;
		i = 1, 2, 3, 4, ... , n ;

		Transform Dec number to other format.

		{An}(n = 1, 2, 3, 4, ... , A0 = 0)
		An = Dec - (Dec / SCALE) * SCALE ; Quotient_n = Dec / SCALE ;	# get remainder.
		Dec = Quotient_n ;
		An-1 = Dec - (Dec / SCALE) * SCALE ; Quotient_n-1 = Dec / SCALE ;
		Dec = Quotient_n-1 ;

		UNTIL quotient = 0 ;
			
Logic order:
	Receives option and target from command-line,then call main procedure to process translating.User can use custom interface in this progam.
	If didnt install any other translating interface,will use default of program.

Feature design:
	Simple translating.There is non some special features be there.

Develop environment:
	Linux 3.10
	gcc 9.3
	glibc 2.17
	CentOS 7

Debug or Other:
	TODO:
	<Debug and TODO.All programs are not probably no bugs.And they are also have the space to optimize.>

Complement:
	<There could place some messages as additional.Addition could explain the project in the further gradation.>

Version:
	v0.01
