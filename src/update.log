	problems:
		1> nums::numscale::defaultGeneralCombine() {
		   got incorrected value from procedure.
		   this error was provoked by char nums::numscale::scaleSymbolMapping(char).
		   it was triggered while do ret-char - '0',but ret-char was assigned a value with the type of int.
		}

		2> nums::numscale::defaultGeneralTransform() {
		   got incorrected value from procedure.
		   this error was provoked by char nums::numscale::scaleSymbolMapping(char).
		   it was triggered when do static_cast<long long int>(ret-char).
		   it provokes the case that the characters all in buffer cant be print.(not correct value)
		}

	resolving:
		rewrite char nums::numscale::scaleSymbolMapping(char).
		dispatch it to two procedures the type are int scaleSymbolMappingCTV(char c)
		and char scaleSymbolMappingVTC(int v).
		call them for different case.
